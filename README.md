# ProcessSequencer

This was done for pedal version 2, as the processes and interconnections had to be integrated into OfxMain. I started doing the sorting/sequencing algorithms in C++, but got tired of constantly having to re-compile and add debugging output statements. So I converted my code into Python and went from there. Once it was able to sort through multiple process/connection arrangements, I transferred the algorithm back into C++.
